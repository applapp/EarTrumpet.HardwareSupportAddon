# EarTrumpet.HardwareSupportAddon

## Note: This addon is under development and not released yet.

This addon adds hardware support to [EarTrumpet](https://github.com/File-New-Project/EarTrumpet).

### Supported hardware:

- MIDI controllers (sliders / rotary potentiometers with linear mapping, buttons, rotary encoders).
- [deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) controllers (using the serial port, suitable e.g. for arduino projects) (sliders / rotary potentiometers, but makers can also map buttons or rotary encoders to linear values in their microcontroller-code to use all functionalities).

The plugin offers extensive configuration possibilities including offset, implicit control inversion, and scaling options.

### Supported commands to be controlled via hardware:

- Changing device and application volumes.
- Muting devices and applications.
- Change the default output device.
